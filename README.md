## Problem
- Event organizers' struggle to gauge attendee interests beforehand.
- Participants often forget about events or lack a clear way to RSVP electronically.
- Optimally planning logistics (food, space, equipment) due to unknown participant numbers.

## Solution
- An app that allows event organizers to create and share event details.
- Users can RSVP to events directly within the app.
- Organizers can view real-time participation data and generate reports.
- Participants can scan attendance codes to confirm their presence.

## Unique Value Proposition
- Simplifies event organizing by allowing easier invitation and details sharing with attendees.
- Provides a simple yet reliable way to receive invitations for events.
- Allows event organizers to get detailed records of reception and attendance for their events.
- Users can explore upcoming events that are shared within the app.

## Unfair Advantage
- Leverage Flutter's cross-platform development for wider reach (Android & iOS).
- Focus on user experience and intuitive interface for easy adoption.
- Integration with social media platforms for event promotion (if applicable).

## Customer Segments
- Event organizers (individuals, clubs, businesses)
- Event participants (general public with diverse interests)

## Key Metrics 
- Number of events created 
- Number of users 
- Active user engagement (event creation, RSVP)
- RSVP conversion rate (interested to attending)

## Channels 
- Get update notifications from organizers regarding changes on events the user will attend.
- App Store and Google Play Store.
- Social media marketing targeted ads.
- Influencer marketing partner with event organizers.
- Content marketing long posts on event planning tips.
